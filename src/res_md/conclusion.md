**The Data:** Data was collected from Kaggle. An interesting thing that should be noted
is that although the data was enough, it still could not cover all possibilities of a
poker hand. Hence, a manual method was provided that gives the answers correctly.

**How can it be extended?:** One can go on with MLP classifier and increase the number of
hidden layers. However, the fact still holds that even with 99% accuracy, the model would
not be able to predict the hand because the training set did not have enough poker hand
combinations. 

**End notes:** It was fun to lay hands on this project as I learned how to apply/include
both ML DL models in an end-to-end project like this. Really helpful to streamlit for
making data apps easier to build and deploy.
